# Curated references (shortlist)

A compact reading & reference list I keep for product conversations and design decisions. Not exhaustive — just the practical pieces I return to most.

## Key papers & articles (concise)
- **“Model Cards for Model Reporting”** — Margaret Mitchell et al.  
  Practical template for publishing model metadata and limitations.

- **“Datasheets for Datasets”** — Timnit Gebru et al.  
  Checklist approach for dataset provenance and documentation.

- **“Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems”** — Sculley et al.  
  Classic on the operational complexity of ML in production.

- **“Why Should I Trust You?”** — Ribeiro, Singh, Guestrin (LIME)  
  Early, readable introduction to local explainability.

- **“A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions”** — Lundberg & Lee (SHAP)  
  Useful for thinking about feature contributions in a consistent framework.

- **“Concrete Problems in AI Safety”** — Amodei et al.  
  Practical framing of safety issues that matter in product contexts.

## Books (product-friendly)
- **“Building Machine Learning Powered Products”** — Emmanuel Ameisen  
  Practical, step-by-step for taking models from idea to production.

- **“Designing Data-Intensive Applications”** — Martin Kleppmann  
  System design primer for reliable data systems (infra thinking).

- **“Human Compatible”** — Stuart Russell  
  Useful lens on AI goals and alignment at a conceptual level.

## Practical guidelines & frameworks
- **Model cards / datasheets** (operationalize these for every public model)  
- **Threat modelling for ML** (consider adversarial vectors and data leakage)  
- **Privacy by design** / local legal checklists (GDPR, local APAC rules when relevant)

## Blogs & online resources (ongoing)
- Engineering blogs from **OpenAI / DeepMind / Google Research** (read for approaches, not product guidance)  
- **Distill.pub** — great explainability pieces and visual explainers  
- Product-oriented posts on **“feature flagging for ML”**, **canarying models**, and **observability** from practitioner blogs

## Communities & conferences
- **FAccT** (fairness, accountability, transparency) — good for ethics + policy trends  
- **NeurIPS / ICML** — technical signal + research direction  
- **Local meetups and product+AI panels** — best for pragmatic, regional insight
